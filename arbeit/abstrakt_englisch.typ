This thesis focuses on the processing, analysis and visualization of forest areas using point clouds. The complete process from the data set to the visualization of the individual trees with relevant information is conducted.

A data set is a lidar scan of a forest area, which is given as a list of points. The points can be stored in any order and only the three-dimensional position is required for each point.

First, the points are automatically divided into individual trees. The analysis then calculates relevant information for the trees and individual points and the data is prepared for the visualization in real time.

The methods, data structures and algorithms presented are implemented in the associated software project. The analysis and visualization of the forest areas are tested and evaluated with the implementation.
