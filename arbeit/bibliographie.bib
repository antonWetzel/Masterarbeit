  abstract = {Abstract Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of lidar-derived methods in plant ecology and forestry. One limitation to these methods is accessing the information content of point clouds, from which tree-scale metrics can be retrieved. This is currently undertaken through laborious and time-consuming manual segmentation of tree-level point clouds from larger-area point clouds, an effort that is impracticable across thousands of stems. Here, we present treeseg, an open-source software to automate this task. This method utilises generic point cloud processing techniques including Euclidean clustering, principal component analysis, region-based segmentation, shape fitting and connectivity testing. This data-driven approach uses few a priori assumptions of tree architecture, and transferability across lidar instruments is constrained only by data quality requirements. We demonstrate the treeseg algorithm here on data acquired from both a structurally simple open forest and a complex tropical forest. Across these data, we successfully automatically extract 96\% and 70\% of trees, respectively, with the remainder requiring some straightforward manual segmentation. treeseg allows ready and quick access to tree-scale information contained in lidar point clouds. treeseg should help contribute to more wide-scale uptake of lidar-derived methods to applications ranging from the estimation of carbon stocks through to descriptions of plant form and function.},

 abstract={Laser scanning point clouds of forest stands were acquired in southwest Germany in 2019 and 2020 from different platforms: an aircraft, an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) and a ground-based tripod. The UAV-borne and airborne laser scanning campaigns cover twelve forest plots of approximately 1 ha. The plots are located in mixed central European forests close to Bretten and Karlsruhe, in the federal state of Baden-W\"{u}rttemberg, Germany. Terrestrial laser scanning was performed in selected locations within the twelve forest plots. Airborne and terrestrial laser scanning point clouds were acquired under leaf-on conditions, UAV-borne laser scans were acquired both under leaf-on and later under leaf-off conditions. In addition to the laser scanning campaigns, forest inventory tree properties (species, height, diameter at breast height, crown base height, crown diameter) were measured in-situ during summer 2019 in six of the twelve 1-ha plots. Single tree point clouds were extracted from the different laser scanning datasets and matched to the field measurements. For each tree entry, point clouds, tree species, position, and field-measured and point cloud-derived tree metrics are provided. For 249 trees, point clouds from all three platforms are available. The tree models form the basis of a single tree database covering a range of species typical for central European forests which is currently being established in the framework of the SYSSIFOSS project.},

Conclusions Acknowledgements References Summary Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) is providing new, very detailed three-dimensional (3D) measurements of forest canopy structure. The information that TLS measurements can provide in describing detailed, accurate 3D canopy architecture offers fascinating new insights into the variety of tree form, environmental drivers and constraints, and the relationship between form and function, particularly for tall, hard-to-measure trees. TLS measurements are helping to test fundamental ecological theories and enabling new and better exploitation of other measurements and models that depend on 3D structural information. This Tansley insight introduces the background and capabilities of TLS in forest ecology, discusses some of the barriers to progress, and identifies some of the directions for new work.},

  abstract  = {This thesis introduces Potree, a web-based renderer for large point clouds. It allows users to view data sets with billions of points, from sources such as LIDAR or photogrammetry, in real time in standard web browsers. One of the main advantages of point cloud visualization in web browser is that it allows users to share their data sets with clients or the public without the need to install third-party applications and transfer huge amounts of data in advance. The focus on large point clouds, and a variety of measuring tools, also allows users to use Potree to look at, analyze and validate raw point cloud data, without the need for a time-intensive and potentially costly meshing step. The streaming and rendering of billions of points in web browsers, without the need to load large amounts of data in advance, is achieved with a hierarchical structure that stores subsamples of the original data at different resolutions. A low resolution is stored in the root node and with each level, the resolution gradually increases. The structure allows Potree to cull regions of the point cloud that are outside the view frustum, and to render distant regions at a lower level of detail. The result is an open source point cloud viewer, which was able to render point cloud data sets of up to 597 billion points, roughly 1.6 terabytes after compression, in real time in a web browser.},

It utilizes a hierarchical counting sort to quickly split the point cloud into small chunks, which are then processed in parallel. Levels of detail are generated by subsampling the full data set bottom up using one of multiple exchangeable sampling strategies. We introduce a fast hierarchical approximate blue-noise strategy and compare it to a uniform random sampling strategy. The throughput, including out-of-core access to disk, generating the octree, and writing the final result to disk, is about an order of magnitude faster than the state of the art, and reaches up to around 6 million points per second for the blue-noise approach and up to around 9 million points per second for the uniform random approach on modern SSDs.},

abstract = {A new method is presented for robustly estimating multiple view relations from point correspondences. The method comprises two parts. The first is a new robust estimator MLESAC which is a generalization of the RANSAC estimator. It adopts the same sampling strategy as RANSAC to generate putative solutions, but chooses the solution that maximizes the likelihood rather than just the number of inliers. The second part of the algorithm is a general purpose method for automatically parameterizing these relations, using the output of MLESAC. A difficulty with multiview image relations is that there are often nonlinear constraints between the parameters, making optimization a difficult task. The parameterization method overcomes the difficulty of nonlinear constraints and conducts a constrained optimization. The method is general and its use is illustrated for the estimation of fundamental matrices, image–image homographies, and quadratic transformations. Results are given for both synthetic and real images. It is demonstrated that the method gives results equal or superior to those of previous approaches.}

The objects modeled in these maps include cupboards, tables, drawers and shelves, which are of particular importance for a household robotic assistant. Our mapping approach is based on PCD (point cloud data) representations. Sophisticated interpretation methods operating on these representations eliminate noise and resample the data without deleting the important details, and interpret the improved point clouds in terms of rectangular planes and 3D geometric shapes. We detail the steps of our mapping approach and explain the key techniques that make it work. The novel techniques include statistical analysis, persistent histogram features estimation that allows for a consistent registration, resampling with additional robust fitting techniques, and segmentation of the environment into meaningful regions.}

ABSTRACT = {An open source tool named SimpleTree, capable of modelling highly accurate cylindrical tree models from terrestrial laser scan point clouds, is presented and evaluated. All important functionalities, accessible in the software via buttons and dialogues, are described including the explanation of all necessary input parameters. The method is validated utilizing 101 point clouds of six different tree species, in the main evergreen and coniferous trees. All scanned trees have been destructively harvested to get accurate estimates of above ground biomass with which we assess the accuracy of the SimpleTree-reconstructed cylinder models. The trees were grouped into four data sets and for each one a Concordance Correlation Coefficient of at least 0.92 (0.92, 0.97, 0.92, 0.94) and an total relative error at most ~8 % (2.42%, 3.59%, –4.59%, 8.27%) was achieved in the comparison of the model results to the ground truth data. A global statistical improvement of derived cylinder radii is presented as well as an efficient optimization approach to automatically improve user given input parameters. An additional check of the SimpleTree results is presented via comparison to the results of trees reconstructed using an alternative, published method.},

abstract = {We present TreePartNet, a neural network aimed at reconstructing tree geometry from point clouds obtained by scanning real trees. Our key idea is to learn a natural neural decomposition exploiting the assumption that a tree comprises locally cylindrical shapes. In particular, reconstruction is a two-step process. First, two networks are used to detect priors from the point clouds. One detects semantic branching points, and the other network is trained to learn a cylindrical representation of the branches. In the second step, we apply a neural merging module to reduce the cylindrical representation to a final set of generalized cylinders combined by branches. We demonstrate results of reconstructing realistic tree geometry for a variety of input models and with varying input point quality, e.g., noise, outliers, and incompleteness. We evaluate our approach extensively by using data from both synthetic and real trees and comparing it with alternative methods.},

  abstract  = "Plants have developed different tropisms: in particular, they
               reorient the growth of their branches towards the light
               (phototropism) or upwards (gravitropism). How these tropisms
               affect the shape of a tree crown remains unanswered. We address
               this question by developing a propagating front model of tree
               growth. Being length-free, this model leads to self-similar
               solutions after a long period of time, which are independent of
               the initial conditions. Varying the intensities of each tropism,
               different self-similar shapes emerge, including singular ones.
               Interestingly, these shapes bear similarities to existing tree
               species. It is concluded that the core of specific crown shapes
               in trees relies on the balance between tropisms.",

abstract = {Due to the increasing use of Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) systems in the forestry domain for forest inventory, the development of software tools for the automatic measurement of forest inventory attributes from TLS data has become a major research field. Numerous research work on the measurement of attributes such as the localization of the trees, the Diameter at Breast Height (DBH), the height of the trees, and the volume of wood has been reported in the literature. However, to the best of our knowledge the problem of tree species recognition from TLS data has received very little attention from the scientific community. Most of the research work uses Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data and measures tree species attributes on large scales. In this paper we propose a method for individual tree species classification of five different species based on the analysis of the 3D geometric texture of the bark. The texture features are computed using a combination of the Complex Wavelet Transforms (CWT) and the Contourlet Transform (CT), and classification is done using the Random Forest (RF) classifier. The method has been tested using a dataset composed of 230 samples. The results obtained are very encouraging and promising.}

abstract = {Individual trees can be detected using high-density airborne laser scanner data. Also, variables characterizing the detected trees such as tree height, crown area, and crown base height can be measured. The Scandinavian boreal forest mainly consists of Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), and deciduous trees. It is possible to separate coniferous from deciduous trees using near-infrared images, but pine and spruce give similar spectral signals. Airborne laser scanning, measuring structure and shape of tree crowns could be used for discriminating between spruce and pine. The aim of this study was to test classification of Scots pine versus Norway spruce on an individual tree level using features extracted from airborne laser scanning data. Field measurements were used for training and validation of the classification. The position of all trees on 12 rectangular plots (50×20 m2) were measured in field and tree species was recorded. The dominating species (>80%) was Norway spruce for six of the plots and Scots pine for six plots. The field-measured trees were automatically linked to the laser-measured trees. The laser-detected trees on each plot were classified into species classes using all laser-detected trees on the other plots as training data. The portion correctly classified trees on all plots was 95%. Crown base height estimations of individual trees were also evaluated (r=0.84). The classification results in this study demonstrate the ability to discriminate between pine and spruce using laser data. This method could be applied in an operational context. In the first step, a segmentation of individual tree crowns is performed using laser data. In the second step, tree species classification is performed based on the segments. Methods could be developed in the future that combine laser data with digital near-infrared photographs for classification with the three classes: Norway spruce, Scots pine, and deciduous trees.}

abstract = {Knowledge of tree species distribution is important worldwide for sustainable forest management and resource evaluation. The accuracy and information content of species maps produced using remote sensing images vary with scale, sensor (optical, microwave, LiDAR), classification algorithm, verification design and natural conditions like tree age, forest structure and density. Imaging spectroscopy reduces the inaccuracies making use of the detailed spectral response. However, the scale effect still has a strong influence and cannot be neglected. This study aims to bridge the knowledge gap in understanding the scale effect in imaging spectroscopy when moving from 4 to 30m pixel size for tree species mapping, keeping in mind that most current and future hyperspectral satellite based sensors work with spatial resolution around 30m or more. Two airborne (HyMAP) and one spaceborne (Hyperion) imaging spectroscopy dataset with pixel sizes of 4, 8 and 30m, respectively were available to examine the effect of scale over a central European forest. The forest under examination is a typical managed forest with relatively homogenous stands featuring mostly two canopy layers. Normalized digital surface model (nDSM) derived from LiDAR data was used additionally to examine the effect of height information in tree species mapping. Six different sets of predictor variables (reflectance value of all bands, selected components of a Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF), Vegetation Indices (VI) and each of these sets combined with LiDAR derived height) were explored at each scale. Supervised kernel based (Support Vector Machines) and ensemble based (Random Forest) machine learning algorithms were applied on the dataset to investigate the effect of the classifier. Iterative bootstrap-validation with 100 iterations was performed for classification model building and testing for all the trials. For scale, analysis of overall classification accuracy and kappa values indicated that 8m spatial resolution (reaching kappa values of over 0.83) slightly outperformed the results obtained from 4m for the study area and five tree species under examination. The 30m resolution Hyperion image produced sound results (kappa values of over 0.70), which in some areas of the test site were comparable with the higher spatial resolution imagery when qualitatively assessing the map outputs. Considering input predictor sets, MNF bands performed best at 4 and 8m resolution. Optical bands were found to be best for 30m spatial resolution. Classification with MNF as input predictors produced better visual appearance of tree species patches when compared with reference maps. Based on the analysis, it was concluded that there is no significant effect of height information on tree species classification accuracies for the present framework and study area. Furthermore, in the examined cases there was no single best choice among the two classifiers across scales and predictors. It can be concluded that tree species mapping from imaging spectroscopy for forest sites comparable to the one under investigation is possible with reliable accuracies not only from airborne but also from spaceborne imaging spectroscopy datasets.}

abstract = {The identification of tree species is an important issue in forest management. In recent years, many studies have explored this topic using hyperspectral, multispectral, and LiDAR data. In this study we analyzed two multi-sensor set-ups: 1) airborne high spatial resolution hyperspectral images combined with LiDAR data; and 2) high spatial resolution satellite multispectral images combined with LiDAR data. Two LiDAR acquisitions were considered: low point density (approx. 0.48points per m2) and high point density (approx. 8.6points per m2). The aims of this work were: i) to understand what level of classification accuracy can be achieved using a high spectral and spatial resolution multi-sensor data set-up (very high spatial and spectral resolution airborne hyperspectral images integrated with high point density LiDAR data), over a mountain area characterized by many species, both broadleaf and coniferous; ii) to understand the implications of a downgrading of the data characteristics (in terms of spectral resolution of spectral data and point density of LiDAR data), on species separability, with respect to the previous set-up; and iii) to understand the differences between high- and low-point density LiDAR acquisitions on tree species classification. The study region was a mountain area in the Southern Alps characterized by many tree species (7 species and a “non-forest” class), either coniferous or broadleaf. For each set-up a specific processing chain was adopted, from the pre-processing of the raw data to the classification (two classifiers were used: support vector machine and random forest). Different class definitions were tested, including general macro-classes, forest types, and finally single tree species. Experimental results showed that the set-up based on hyperspectral data was effective with general macro-classes, forest types, and single species, reaching high kappa accuracies (93.2%, 82.1% and 76.5%, respectively). The use of multispectral data produced a reduction in the classification accuracy, which was sharp for single tree species, and still high for forest types. Considering general macro-classes, the multispectral set-up was still very accurate (85.8%). Regarding LiDAR data, the experimental analysis showed that high density LiDAR data provided more information for tree species classification with respect to low density data, when combined with either hyperspectral or multispectral data.}

abstract = {While mobile LiDAR sensors are increasingly used to scan in ecology and forestry applications, reconstruction and characterization are typically carried out offline. Motivated by this, we present an online LiDAR system which is capable of running on a handheld device. Our system is capable of creating 3D point cloud reconstructions of large forest areas, segment and track individual trees, and create an inventory for the detected trees. Segments relating to each tree are accumulated over time, and tree models are completed as more scans are captured from different perspectives. The LiDAR scans are processed in an online fashion, and feedback can be provided to the operator via a screen mounted on the device. This allows the operator to ensure the desired area is mapped satisfactorily without any gaps or missing sections. We employ a pose-graph based SLAM system with loop closures to correct for drift errors allowing us to map large areas accurately. Our mapping system also provides multi-session capability where data captured during different runs can be automatically merged in a post-processing step. In this work, we estimate the Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) of individual trees as an example parameter for the forest inventory. The DBH is estimated online by fitting a cylinder to each tree trunk through a least-squares optimization within a RANSAC loop. We demonstrate our mapping approach operating in two different forests (both ecological and commercial) with the total travel distance spanning several kilometres. Further, we also provide experimental results comparing our DBH estimation to ground-truth measurements recorded manually in an ecological forest (Wytham Woods, Oxford). We demonstrate that our DBH estimates are within ∼7 cm accuracy for 90% of individual trees detected in the dataset.}

abstract = {In recent years, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology has been one of the most innovative subjects in laser scanning, remote sensing, and object detection systems. This technology may be popular because it can pinpoint structures or zones of interest in millimetre detail. It can also highlight variations and irregularities, such as surface degradation and vegetation growth. This paper presents a review of the specialised literature on LiDAR systems applied to precision agriculture; specifically, in cultivating crops. First, some preliminaries of LiDAR systems according to the mode of transport used, considering terrestrial, mobile, and aerial laser scanners, are given. Subsequently, a well-organised taxonomy of recent LiDAR applications based on the activity being performed is presented. Here, the following four categories are considered: (1) crop-related metric estimation, (2) tree and plant digitisation, (3) vision systems for object detection and navigation, and (4) planning and decision support. Lastly, we discuss some current trends and research challenges in applying LiDAR technology to cultivation activities in accordance with the state-of-the-art literature.}
