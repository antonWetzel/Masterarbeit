  abstract = {Abstract Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of lidar-derived methods in plant ecology and forestry. One limitation to these methods is accessing the information content of point clouds, from which tree-scale metrics can be retrieved. This is currently undertaken through laborious and time-consuming manual segmentation of tree-level point clouds from larger-area point clouds, an effort that is impracticable across thousands of stems. Here, we present treeseg, an open-source software to automate this task. This method utilises generic point cloud processing techniques including Euclidean clustering, principal component analysis, region-based segmentation, shape fitting and connectivity testing. This data-driven approach uses few a priori assumptions of tree architecture, and transferability across lidar instruments is constrained only by data quality requirements. We demonstrate the treeseg algorithm here on data acquired from both a structurally simple open forest and a complex tropical forest. Across these data, we successfully automatically extract 96\% and 70\% of trees, respectively, with the remainder requiring some straightforward manual segmentation. treeseg allows ready and quick access to tree-scale information contained in lidar point clouds. treeseg should help contribute to more wide-scale uptake of lidar-derived methods to applications ranging from the estimation of carbon stocks through to descriptions of plant form and function.},

 abstract={Laser scanning point clouds of forest stands were acquired in southwest Germany in 2019 and 2020 from different platforms: an aircraft, an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) and a ground-based tripod. The UAV-borne and airborne laser scanning campaigns cover twelve forest plots of approximately 1 ha. The plots are located in mixed central European forests close to Bretten and Karlsruhe, in the federal state of Baden-W\"{u}rttemberg, Germany. Terrestrial laser scanning was performed in selected locations within the twelve forest plots. Airborne and terrestrial laser scanning point clouds were acquired under leaf-on conditions, UAV-borne laser scans were acquired both under leaf-on and later under leaf-off conditions. In addition to the laser scanning campaigns, forest inventory tree properties (species, height, diameter at breast height, crown base height, crown diameter) were measured in-situ during summer 2019 in six of the twelve 1-ha plots. Single tree point clouds were extracted from the different laser scanning datasets and matched to the field measurements. For each tree entry, point clouds, tree species, position, and field-measured and point cloud-derived tree metrics are provided. For 249 trees, point clouds from all three platforms are available. The tree models form the basis of a single tree database covering a range of species typical for central European forests which is currently being established in the framework of the SYSSIFOSS project.},

abstract = {Contents Summary I. Introduction II. Terrestrial laser scanning III. Turning points into trees IV. Current and future applications of TLS V. Conclusions Acknowledgements References Summary Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) is providing new, very detailed three-dimensional (3D) measurements of forest canopy structure. The information that TLS measurements can provide in describing detailed, accurate 3D canopy architecture offers fascinating new insights into the variety of tree form, environmental drivers and constraints, and the relationship between form and function, particularly for tall, hard-to-measure trees. TLS measurements are helping to test fundamental ecological theories and enabling new and better exploitation of other measurements and models that depend on 3D structural information. This Tansley insight introduces the background and capabilities of TLS in forest ecology, discusses some of the barriers to progress, and identifies some of the directions for new work.},
